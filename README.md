How to use:
1. Download the .ZIP file.
2. Put the 'Networking-main' folder anywhere you'd like.
3. Go into the code and find 's.connect('xxx.xx.xx.xxx', port)'.
4. Change the X's to the IP address of the server you want to connect to.
5. Match the port number with the port number of the server.
6. Run 'client.py'. This will open a terminal to input your username.

You can now chat with other clients.
